## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go (version 1.18 or higher)
- Gemini AI API Key (set as an environment variable `GEMINI_API_KEY`)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashish0kumar/GemGo.git
cd GemGo
```

2. To use `gemgo`, you'll need an API key set in the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable. If you don't already have one, create a key in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

4. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key:

  - For Linux/macOS:

  ```bash
  export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
  ```

  - For Windows (PowerShell):

  ```powershell
  $env:GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
  ```

3. Build and run the application:

```bash
go build -o gemgo
./gemgo
```

### Configure Global CLI Access

To run `gemgo` from anywhere in your terminal, follow these steps:

**For Linux/macOS:**

1. Move the binary to `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
sudo mv gemgo /usr/local/bin/
```

2. Ensure `/usr/local/bin` is in your `$PATH`:

Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or appropriate shell config file if not already present:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

3. Reload your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc for zsh users
```

**For Windows:**

1. Move the binary to a directory included in your system's `PATH`. You can create a directory like `C:\CLI-tools` and add it to the `PATH`:

- Open **Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables**.
- Under **System variables**, find the `Path` variable, select it, and click Edit.
- Click **New**, and add the `path` where you moved the `gemgo.exe` binary (e.g., `C:\CLI-tools`).
- Click **OK** to save the changes.

2. Move the `gemgo.exe` binary to this directory:

```powershell
move gemgo.exe C:\CLI-tools
```
    

After this, you can access `gemgo` globally from any terminal window.

#### Running the Application

Once globally installed, you can run `gemgo` by typing:

```bash
gemgo
```

## üîß Usage

Once you run the CLI, you can start typing questions. To submit a query, press Enter. To exit, press `Ctrl+C` or `Esc`.
